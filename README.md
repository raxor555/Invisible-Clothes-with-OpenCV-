# Invisible-Clothes-with-OpenCV-
Ever wished you could turn invisible—like in sci-fi movies? Well, I just made it happen (sort of 😉)! Using OpenCV and Python, I built an Invisible T-Shirt project that creates a mind-blowing cloaking effect. 🚀

👀 How It Works:
 🔹 Capture the background before the subject enters the frame.
 🔹 Detect the chosen "invisible" color in real time.
 🔹 Replace the detected area with the pre-captured background, making it seem like the person vanishes!
🎥 The result? A Harry Potter-inspired Invisibility Cloak but with a tech twist! 🪄
